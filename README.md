# gQuant - GPU Accelerated Framework for Quantitative Analyst Tasks

**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/gquant/blob/master/README.md) ensure you are on the `master` branch.

## What is gQuant?
gQuant is a collection of open-source GPU accelerated Python tools and examples  for quantitative analyst tasks,  built on top of the [RAPIDS AI](https://rapids.ai/) project, [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), and [Dask](https://dask.org/).

The examples range from simple accelerated calculation of technical trading indicators through defining workflows for interactively developing trading strategies and automating many typical tasks.

The extensibility of the system is highlighted by examples showing how to create a dataframe flow graph, which allows for easy re-use and composability of higher level workflows.

The examples also show how to easily convert a single-threaded solution into a Dask distributed one. 

These examples can be used as-is or, as they are open source, can be extended to suit your environments.
